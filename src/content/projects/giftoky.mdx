GIFTOKY® is an app that allows users to note and share gift ideas, transforming them into meaningful presents. Developed with React Native and Expo for the front-end, it ensures an efficient user experience, while the back-end is powered by Node.js and WordPress. The app facilitates the creation of personalized wish lists and social interaction, enabling users to follow friends' profiles and anonymously reserve gifts. GIFTOKY® streamlines gift planning and prevents duplicate presents, offering a free and accessible solution to enhance the quality and significance of received gifts. I joined the project after a year of prior development, resuming the paused work and successfully getting the app to work correctly on both iOS and Android.
