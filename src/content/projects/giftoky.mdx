I worked as a developer of the GIFTOKY app, the app was already in development when I joined the project but it was not working properly, now is entering the public beta. Giftoky works as a wishlist app but with a social component, so you can share your wishlist and interact with your friends wishlists by marking as reserved wish or given wish and more.
