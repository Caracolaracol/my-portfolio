My team and I developed this mobile app for the Federation of Private Educational Institutions (FIDE) in Chile, designed to connect school teams affiliated with FIDE. The app provides a platform for communication, delivering news, and sending relevant notifications to the educational community. Built using Flutterflow and Dart for the front-end, with WordPress (ACF) and PHP handling the back-end, it enables seamless interaction between members, keeping them informed and connected. The app is a vital tool for FIDE-affiliated schools to stay updated on institutional matters and collaborate more effectively.
