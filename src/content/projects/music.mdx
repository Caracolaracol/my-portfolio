    Tormenta China was a rock band born to serve Santiago’s underground rock
    scene. Named after the racehorse Tormenta China, famously bet on by Juan
    Carlos Bodoque, the band’s fate mirrored that of the horse—it never won a
    race. Just like its namesake, the band delved deep into the underground,
    becoming a cult figure in Chilean progressive rock.

    Bichonauta is a rock/pop band from Santiago de Chile, featuring Agustín
    Rojas, Pascal Chaperón, Pablo Vergara, and Camilo Ortega. Their unique
    approach involves storytelling and creating narratives through their music
    and stage presence, blending progressive and psychedelic styles to craft a
    distinct sound.

I also took part in an experimental project known informally as Quebrada Radiocontrol.
This project was more than just music—it included experimental videos as well.

As a solo artist I created an album called Caracol by compiling old sheet music, with each track offering something completely different from the rest.
