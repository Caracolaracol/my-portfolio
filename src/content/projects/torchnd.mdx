Torchnd is basically a booking app like Airbnb, but with a fun twist—it's all about fictional places and hosts. I built it using Expo, and it works smoothly on both Android and iOS. This was my first dive into app development and design, and it’s been a great learning journey. I also added some cool gamification features with the quick help of AI to make the experience more engaging.
