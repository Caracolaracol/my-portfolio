Take a look at the different kinds of art I've made over my lifetime. I've worked with many materials and disciplines, each one giving me a new way to show my creativity.

My work includes shaping and painting with ceramics and acrylics. I have also ventured into digital artwork, creating pieces that feel both new and timeless. Additionally, I've explored sound manipulation in theater, crafting stories by mixing sounds and performances.
