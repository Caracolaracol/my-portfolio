This is a Remake of the Ironplant website, a Vegan brand selling food supplements. I did this site for the final project of the React Js bootcamp at Coderhouse, where I forged a lot of my web development skills. In this project you can actually simulate a purchase, it has itemlists, filtered items, item details, cart and a checkout form.

<div className='w-[240px] mx-auto'>
<Image src={frontmatter.illustrations[0]} alt='frog' height={240} width={240}/>
</div>
