This is a language course platform, I worked at this project as a team made up of the best students of the latest bootcamps of web development and web design at 'Coderhouse' an e-learning platform based in Argentina, so it was a excelent job experience and the result was this site made for a language course institute. They teach English, Spanish, Italian and Portuguese.
